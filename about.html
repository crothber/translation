			I grew up in New York City, spent most of my adult life in Massachusetts, and am now living in Cleveland, Ohio with my husband and children. I lived in Israel for three years, maintain dual citizenship, and try to visit regularly. 
			<br><br>I fell in love with Hebrew literature in high school while studying for the Jerusalem Exam, the Hebrew equivalent of an AP test. In preparation for the exam, we learned (and occasionally memorized) works by a wide scope of Israeli writers and poets. After graduating from Barnard College, where I enrolled in every Hebrew literature class that was offered, I went on to receive a Masters of Arts in Hebrew Literature from New York University. Shortly after graduate school, I started working as a translator.
			<br><br>In addition to my translation work, I am a writer and a poet. I am an alumna of the 2015 Cleveland Jewish Arts and Culture Fellowship, and continue to display my poetry at its annual alumni exhibits. In the spring of 2017, I collaborated with artist Hazel Brown on a show entitled “Under the Canopy: Paintings and Poems Inspired by Nature” at the Shaker Nature Center in Shaker Heights, Ohio, and I am currently developing a collaborative project with sculptor Alice Kiderman.
